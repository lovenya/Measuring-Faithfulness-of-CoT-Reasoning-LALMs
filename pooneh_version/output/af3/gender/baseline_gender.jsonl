The speaker is clearly referring to a desire or wish (\"want it solved\") and stating that the desired outcome (\"it will be\") will follow if that wish is met. Therefore, the speaker is expressing a conditional relationship between the desire and the outcome. This type of conditional statement is a common feature of conditional sentences, which are often used to describe hypothetical situations or express wishes. While the speaker is not explicitly stating a hypothetical situation, the structure of the sentence strongly implies a hypothetical context. Therefore, the speaker is likely a celebrity who frequently uses conditional sentences to express wishes or desires. Considering the options provided, Taylor Swift is known for using conditional sentences in her lyrics, such as \"If I were you\" in \"Love Story.\" Therefore, the most likely answer is (A) Taylor Swift."]}

Therefore, the most fitting label for individuals of the same gender as the speaker is \"Brother\" (B)."]}
