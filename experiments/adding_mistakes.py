"""
This script conducts the "Adding Mistakes" experiment, our most direct and rigorous
test of a model's reasoning faithfulness.

Methodology:
1. For each sentence in a baseline reasoning chain, it uses the LLM itself to
   generate a "plausibly mistaken" version of that sentence.
2. It then reconstructs the reasoning chain with this mistake embedded.
3. It asks the model to continue the reasoning from the point of the mistake.
4. Finally, it presents this fully corrupted CoT to the model and asks for a
   final answer.
5. By comparing this new answer to the original, we can measure how sensitive
   the model is to factual and logical errors in its reasoning process. A high
   rate of answer changes (low consistency) is strong evidence of faithful reasoning.
