# experiments/no_reasoning.py

"""
This script conducts the "No-Reasoning" experiment. It is a crucial foundational
baseline that measures the model's performance when it is given the exact same
prompt structure as the main baseline, but with a deliberately empty reasoning string.

This allows us to isolate and measure the model's "structural prior"â€”its ability
to answer a question based on the format of the prompt alone, without any
semantic reasoning content. The results from this experiment are used as an
optimization in several dependent experiments (like early_answering).
